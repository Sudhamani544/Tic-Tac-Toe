# Tic-Tac-Toe

1. Program should play the game using 'X's
2. User should play the game using 'O's
3. First move belongs to the program(computer) - it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board
4. All the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1
5. User inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose - the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied
6. Program generates number using randrange function from random module.
